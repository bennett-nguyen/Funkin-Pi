# Funkin-Pi
A FNF rip-off but with RTX 3080 RAY TRACING 4K 60 FPS ULTRA REALISTIC graphics that doesn't require you to have a good graphic card to play this game (cool right?)

# Why is this here?
It has been 6 months since my declaration about the release date of the game. But, the game still hasn't been completed to this point. The main reason for the procrastination is my laziness; others include: school, other work, and especially that my old computer was broken and I had to wait for 2 months for a new one.

And to not feel guilty about myself every night for not completing the game. I will make this repository public and show the Internet my shitty-ass python code.

# When will it be completed?

I don't want to make any promises but I assure you that the demo version will be released at the end of summer (or earlier)
